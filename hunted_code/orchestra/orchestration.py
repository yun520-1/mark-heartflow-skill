            Consider the flow of information through the tasks when writing your orchestration: **if the final task depends on the output of an earlier task, you must include the task_id of the task it depends on in the "use_output_from" field**.
            Your team members can handle multiple similar tasks in one instruction.
            For example, if you want a travel agent to find flights and a spreadsheet agent to create a spreadsheet with the flight options, you *MUST* include the task_id of the travel related task in the "use_output_from" field of the spreadsheet agent's task.
            Your instruction should be an extensive and well engineered prompt instruction for the agent. Don't just issue a simple instruction string; tell it what to do and achieve, and what its final response should be.

            - What information each task needs
            - Which tasks depend on outputs from other tasks
            - How to sequence the tasks efficiently
